## Experience

Most of my backend code is in TS as it was the first language I delved into.

As for frontend, I know JavaScript/TS, Vue, Tailwind, and CSS.

I am learning golang, which can be viewed at [Folderr CLI](https://github.com/Folderr/foldcli) or [Mirror Server](https://github.com/Folderr/Mirror-Server)

I mainly work on backend APIs that utilize <a href="https://expressjs.com">ExpressJS</a> and <a href="https://fastify.io">Fastify</a> for web servers, with the database being MongoDB paired with <a href="https://https://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose ODM</a>

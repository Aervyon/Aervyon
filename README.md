I'm Aervyon, a self-proclaimed young developer. Most of my code is in TS/JS as they were the first two languages I delved into.
Most of my commits are currently done on private repositories (some of which are hopefully going to be open sourced in the future)

As for frontend, I know JavaScript, Vue, Tailwind, a little bit of CSS, and some HTML. Still working on the fine details with those however.

I was learning python, but I have no projects that use Python nor am making any that will use Python soon.

*Stay tuned for the potential to see some snakes*

I'm busy and am not currently tending to code issues.

I mainly work on backend APIs using <a href="https://expressjs.com">ExpressJS</a> and <a href="https://fastify.io">Fastify</a> for web servers, with my preferred database being MongoDB paired with <a href="https://https://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose ODM</a>

If you're a discord user you might enjoy this repository. *You do need a Windows/Linux/MacOS device however, must have the Discord RPC active*

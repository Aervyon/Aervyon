## Experience

Most of my backend code is in TS as it was the first language I delved into.

As for frontend, I know TypeScript, Vue, some React, Tailwind, and CSS.

I am learning golang, which can be viewed at [Folderr CLI](https://github.com/Folderr/foldcli) or [Mirror Server](https://github.com/Folderr/Mirror-Server)

I mainly work on backend APIs that utilize [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com) or [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) for web servers (with a preference for Fastify due to typings and performance), with the database *usually* being MongoDB

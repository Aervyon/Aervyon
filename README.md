I'm Aervyon, a self-proclaimed web developer.

🏫 Full time student

🌐 https://aervyon.com - My website, built on Nuxt & Tailwind. Has a few more details about myself

⛔ I'm busy and am not currently tending to code issues.

🔑 Do everyone (and yourself!) a favor and use a password manager

## Experience

Most of my backend code is in TS/JS as they were the first two languages I delved into.

As for frontend, I know JavaScript, Vue, Tailwind, a little bit of CSS, and some HTML.

I was learning python, however, I have no use for it *at the time of writing*

*Stay tuned for the potential to see some snakes 🐍*

I mainly work on backend APIs that utilize <a href="https://expressjs.com">ExpressJS</a> and <a href="https://fastify.io">Fastify</a> for web servers, with the database being MongoDB paired with <a href="https://https://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose ODM</a>
